# Ceres Example Project

This repository is intended to provide practical examples of basic Ceres usage, as
well as the infrastructure for a sample project which includes the library.
This is not intended as a replacement for the excellent and comprehensive
[Ceres Documentation](http://ceres-solver.org/), but rather as a pedogogical tool
and starting template for optimization projects.
